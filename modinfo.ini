name=Ship Shape: Shifting Tides
author="Me"
description="How do you improve a level which is already infamous as being the best of the best? You add randomized walls which block your paths to it![br][br][br]That's right, Shifting Tides introduces a walls mechanic designed to ruin your day! Expect frustrating blockages to the paths you desperately need and be prepared to take massive detours! All rooms always have a path;  it just may not be the most convenient one.[br][br][br]Shifting Tides is the introductory Death Wish, which is essentially Ship Shape with Walls[br][br][br]However, there is also a 2nd Death Wish, which some say is even more dastardly and could even be compared to... Cruisin' for a Bruisin'.[br][br][br]Hope you have fun with this mechanic, I certainly enjoyed all the frustration it caused me. You'll question if the randomizer is out to get you, then you'll question whether the Taskmaster just does not want you to have a good day. Enjoy!"
