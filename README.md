# Ship Shape: Shifting Tides
Shifting Tides is a Death Wish which introduces a new mechanic to Ship Shape, randomized walls which block your paths.

These walls encourage quick thinking and on-the-spot strategy to re-adjust your route and build a mental image of the map to successfully clear tasks.

Each time you clear a task, the walls are randomized yet again, and you must rebuild your internal map to clear the mission.
